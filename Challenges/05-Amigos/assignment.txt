Write a program that, given the number of tickets that John has to offer and the number of tickets that each of his friends has asked for, calculate the number of tickets that John should give to each friend.

Input
The first line of the input has an integer, B, which represents the number of tickets John has to give away. The second line has an integer, N , which denotes the number of John's friends. This is followed by N lines, each with an integer, p, which is the number of tickets that one of John's friends has asked him for.

Constraints
1 ≤ B ≤ 400
1 ≤ N ≤ 30
1 ≤ p ≤ 25

Output
The output has one line for each friend, in the order defined in the input. Each line has the number of tickets John should give to his friend.
