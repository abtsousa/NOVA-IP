Task
GiraMeta - the company that controls the main social networks for sunflowers - hired us to develop a program that detects shallow fakes in published photos. We already the module that counts the number of spirals in each direction - clockwise and counterclockwise. Some sunflowers are transgenic and have lots of spirals! We now need a program that determines which pairs correspond to real sunflowers. That is, whose number of spirals in each direction are consecutive numbers of the Fibonacci sequence.

Input
The first line of the input contains an integer, N , which is the number of photographs to be analyzed. This is followed by N lines, each with two integers, A and B, which indicate the numbers of spirals clockwise and anticlockwise of the photograph of a sunflower.

Constraints
1 ≤ N ≤ 200
1 ≤ A < 20 000
1 ≤ B < 20 000

Output
The output has one line for each photo, in the order defined in the input. Each line has a word, which classifies the corresponding values from the input. That word is: "OK" (without quotes), if the two values are consecutive numbers in the Fibonacci sequence; "FAKE" (without quotes), otherwise. Note that the values do not have to be in ascending order to be consecutive numbers in the Fibonacci sequence.
