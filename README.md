My solutions to the exercises and homeworks of the Intro to Programming (IP) 2022/2023 Course at FCT NOVA.

The language used was Java.

The folder structure is as follows:

- Exercises: Weekly exercises from each lab class as homework (graded), enumerated.
- Challenges: Harder, optional homework exercises.
- Misc: Exercises made during the class, with the teacher's supervision.
- Tests: My solutions to old class tests and exams.

Each exercise / challenge / project is in its own subfolder and has a small txt file with a quick explanation of what we were told to do.

**There's also a couple of (bigger) final projects** (based on the Game of Life) that are published in their own repo NOVA-IP-Gloria. Each one had a two-week deadline.
