My solutions to the exercises and homeworks of the Intro to Programming (IP) 2022/2023 Course at FCT NOVA.

The exercises are separated by folders that are enumerated with the corresponding lab class.

Each folder has a small txt file with a quick explanation of what we were told to do for the exercise.
