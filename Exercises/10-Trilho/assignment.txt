Task
Make a program that, given a maze, writes the description of the track and the sum of all the numbers on the track to the console.

Make sure that Little Mary never has several choices: at each step, she can either draw a ball in a single position or she can't draw any more balls. It is also ensured that the trail has at least two numbers (so its description has some letters).
Input
On the first line there are two integers, L and C, which represent, respectively, the number of rows and the number of columns in the maze. The next L lines describe the maze. Each of these lines has C numbers from 1 to 9, separated by a space.

Restrictions
1 ≤ L ≤ 50
 Number of lines in the maze
1 ≤ C ≤ 50
 Number of columns in the maze
2 ≤ L × C
 Number of digits in the maze

Output
The first line of the output has the description of the track (which is a non-empty sequence of letters 'C', 'D', 'B' and 'E'). The second line has the sum of all the numbers on the trail.
